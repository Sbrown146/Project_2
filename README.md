An interactive dashboard of the statistical analysis on the effects of altitude on professional sports.

Data to be collected via api, imported and further organized/cleaned in postgres and then brought in through sqlalchemy for final use. Choose a league to further choose a team within that league. Information regarding win percentage vs altitude will be displayed in a chart, graphs and a leaflet plot to display statistical information. A conclusion will be included based on the information gathered as well as links to scientific studies showcasing the relationship between altitude and athletics.
