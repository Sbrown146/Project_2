Project 2 Brad, Cathryn & Scott UCF DATA Visualization.

An interactive dashboard of the statistical analysis on the effects of altitude on professional sports.

Data to be collected via api, imported and further organized/cleaned in postgres and then brought in through sqlalchemy for final use. Choose a league to further choose a team within that league. Information regarding win percentage vs altitude will be displayed in a chart, graphs and a leaflet plot to display statistical information. A conclusion will be included based on the information gathered as well as links to scientific studies showcasing the relationship between altitude and athletics.


Everything on the heroku page is working properly except for the NFL simulations.  When first switching for the NFL data, the correlation for league home win % vs altitude is correctly displayed (it is positive) but it changes to negative whenever a different nfl team is selected.  The simulation graph is also not correct.  A workaround will be found for this at some point but for now, a screenshot of how the simulation is supposed to look has been added to the references tab on the bottom of the page.
